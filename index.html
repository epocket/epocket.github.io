<h2>Customer Projects and Engineering Services</h2>
Electric Pocket has been developing software for small and mobile devices from our offices in Monmouth and Pontypool, Wales, UK, since 1997. We have used this experience to develop a wide range of applications and services on smartphones and other small devices for partners from small local companies through to global-scale Wireless Carriers, Smartphone Manufacturers and Telecoms Equipment providers.
<p>
Electric Pocket’s team has a history of delivering projects in a timely, friendly and professional manner. We specialise in pragmatic engineering, rather than “agency style” work, and have a keen interest and enjoyment in solving difficult technical challenges. We hone our development skills with our own range of apps, and have experience with latest platforms and technology including Apple, smartwatches, bluetooth beacons, smart home, FLIR, robotics, IOT and NFC.
<p>
Our customer roster includes big names such as Sony, Ericsson, Vodafone and Samsung, and notable successes along the way include deployment of Telecoms-grade Multimedia Messaging (MMS) technology in over 5 Million devices across Palm’s pioneering Treo smartphone family, a music discovery application for Vodafone and TecTiles – Samsung’s acclaimed NFC tagging App. We’ve also worked on voice-assist software, embedded systems for smart heating controllers, RF systems for AIS receivers and a host of mobile-server integrations.
<p>
Chris Mairs, Metaswitch’s Chief Technical Officer said “Electric Pocket has been a great complement to our in-house mobile app development team. We have been very pleased with the quality and timeliness of their work.” Fred Zimbric, Samsung’s Sr. Manager, Product Planning, was delighted with the agile development work on TecTiles – “We’re a hit! Thanks guys, this has been a fun project!”. One of our most recent projects is an 18 month collaborative research and development program creating a game changing solution for measuring energy flow in buildings, HEAT3D.
<p>
Electric Pocket has received awards for innovation from the European Union and Innovate UK and regularly attends mobile industry seminars and conferences, including Apple’s annual WWDC event.
